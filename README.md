# moodify (Third place @ AI Hacks)
Inspiration

Showing your emotions to people around and be vulnerable with yourself are the two most unappreciated skills that a human can have. Only when you understand yourself can you empathize with other people and regulate your own emotion better. However, considering toxic masculinity and many other society phenomenons, these skills are seen as a sign of weakness.  We want to help people under such mindset to slowly take step-by-step to reach such goal. Moreover, mood tracking can help people recognize their patterns, reflect on their action and behavior.


What it does

Using Cohere Classification, the chatbot will classify your emotion into different type. And from there, it will give you the appropriate answer and recommendations on ways to elevate your mood. The chatbot will also make a prediction on your mood for that day


How I built it

I built it with Django as back end and HTML/CSS with bootstrap as front end


Challenges I ran into

I BUILT EVERYTHING BY MYSELF!!! So it was quite a learning curve figuring out cohere and their dataset, using it alongside Django while building the front end. My biggest regret was I could not deploy it because website kept asking for credit cards :( \n


Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Just my result in general! I was really engrossed in building the project and thought it was quite a fun experience. Again very sad I could not show it


What I learned

Database How AI works in general
